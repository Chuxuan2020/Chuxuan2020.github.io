            <h2>About Me</h2>
	    <p>Hello! My name is Chuxuan Li and I’m a Ph.D. candidate studying hydro-climate extreme events in <strong><a href="https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/">the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Northwestern University</a></strong>.</p>
	    <p> </p>
	    <p>I was born and grew up in southern China. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Marine Sciences from <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University">Sun Yat-sen University</a></strong>, a top 10 university in China. In 2014, my journey toward a B.A. took me to Taiwan as an exchange student where I spent half a year. The post-secondary education I received along with my living experiences in coastal areas stimulated my interests in the oceanic and atmospheric sciences. Therefore, in 2017 I decided to go abroad to further these pursuits.</p>
            <p> </p>
	    <p>That’s how I ended up in the U.S. Graduate studies at the <strong><a href="https://www.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill</a></strong> provided me with the opportunity to explore, understand, and learn the details of <strong> atmospheric rivers (ARs) </strong>. From 2017 to 2020, I worked on the variability and predictability of AR activities over the North Atlantic. In two publications, we used high-resolution climate model outputs to investigate the modulation of large-scale climate modes on the occurrence frequency of ARs and the clustering behaviors of AR tracks and the induced extreme precipitation and winds.</p>
            <p> </p>
	    <p>After I completed my Master’s degree at UNC, I joined <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/danethan/"><strong>Dr. Daniel Horton’s Climate Change Research Group (CCRG)</a></strong> in July 2020. Here, I use numerical models and remote sensing to study hydrological extremes and land surface hazards caused by ARs on the west coast of the U.S. In a 2022 publication, I assessed the debris-flow susceptibility for several wildfire burn scars from the 2020 wildfire season over a regional domain in central California. In another publication, I improved WRF-Hydro’s performance to simulate soil moisture and streamflow using state-of-the-science soil characteristic estimates. Ongoing research includes a probabilistic reforecast of hydro-geomorphic hazards over California. Ongoing collaborative research covers topics in urban flooding, landslide prediction, LIDAR-informed postfire debris flow retrospective simulations, soil moisture in compound hazards, and heat vulnerability. </p>
