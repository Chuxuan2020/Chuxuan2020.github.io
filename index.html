            <h2>About Me</h2>
	    <p>Hello! My name is Chuxuan Li and I’m a Ph.D. candidate studying hydroclimate in <strong>the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Northwestern University</strong>.</p>
	    <p> </p>
	    <p>I was born and grew up in southern China. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Marine Sciences from <strong>Sun Yat-sen University</strong>, a top 10 university in China, located in the beautiful coastal city of Guangdong Province. In 2014, my journey toward a B.A. took me to Taiwan as an exchange student where I spent half a year. The post-secondary education I received along with my living experiences in coastal areas stimulated my interests in the oceanic and atmospheric sciences. Therefore, in 2017 I decided to go abroad to further these pursuits.</p>
            <p> </p>
	    <p>That’s how I ended up in the U.S. Graduate studies at the <strong>University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill</strong> provided me with the opportunity to explore, understand, and learn the details of <strong> atmospheric rivers (ARs) </strong>. From 2017 to 2020, I worked on the variability and predictability of AR activities over the North Atlantic. In two publications, we used high-resolution climate model outputs to investigate the modulation of large-scale climate modes on the occurrence frequency of ARs and the clustering behaviors of AR tracks and the induced extreme precipitation and winds.</p>
            <p> </p>
	    <p>After I completed my Master’s degree at UNC, I joined <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/danethan/"><strong>Dr. Horton’s Climate Change Research Group (CCRG)</a></strong> in July 2020. Here, I study hydrological extremes and land surface hazards caused by ARs on the west coast of the U.S. using numerical modeling and remote sensing. In a 2022 publication, I assessed the debris-flow susceptibility for several wildfire burn scars from the 2020 wildfire season over a regional domain in central California. In another publication, I improved WRF-Hydro’s performance to simulate soil moisture and streamflow using state-of-the-science soil characteristic estimates. Ongoing research includes a probabilistic forecast of hydro-geomorphic hazards over California. Ongoing collaborative research covers topics in urban flooding, landslide prediction, LIDAR-informed postfire debris flow retrospective simulations, soil moisture in compound hazards, and heat vulnerability. </p>

            <p>During January 2023, a parade of atmospheric rivers brought record-breaking rain and snowfall to California, causing widespread flooding and over 600 landslides. Flooding and landslide events were triggered by a mixture of hydro-geomorphic processes including infiltration-excess runoff in previously burned terrains, saturation-excess runoff, and snowmelt events. To enhance our capability to forecast these types of hydro-geomorphic hazards at regional scales, here we employ the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Water Model, WRF-Hydro, in conjunction with archived meteorological predictions from the 30-member Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), to resolve relevant physical processes and probabilistically hindcast California’s susceptibility to hydro-geomorphic hazards during the January 2023 event. We validate WRF-Hydro baseline simulations using both streamflow and in-situ soil moisture observations. At the 36 U.S. Geological Survey streamflow sites we produce a mean Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.6 while the mean KGE at the 49 soil moisture sites is 0.61, indicating good model performance. To create an ensemble of equally probable hydrological realizations, we run the validated WRF-Hydro using meteorological forcings from each of the 30 GEFS realizations. To estimate hazard susceptibility levels within each Hydrologic Unit Code 12 (HUC12) catchment in our domain, we multiply the peak discharge by the mean catchment slope and divide by the catchment area. We repeat this calculation for the 30 WRF-Hydro realizations and then probabilistically estimate hazard susceptibilities within each HUC12 catchment across California, in line with state-of-the-science meteorological forecast techniques. Our ensemble mean indicates high hydro-geomorphic hazard susceptibility near San Francisco Bay, the Sierra Nevada foothills, and the Coast Range of southern California – a spatial pattern that broadly agrees with reported landslide occurrences compiled by the California Geological Survey. Our results indicate that the modeling framework employed here has the potential to probabilistically forecast hydro-geomorphic hazards over large spatial scales. However, extensive research and testing is needed before such applications are operationalized. </p>

	<h3>Modeling regional-scale postfire debris flow susceptibility</h3>

	    <p> In steep wildfire-burned terrains, intense rainfall can produce large runoff that can trigger highly destructive debris flows. However, the ability to accurately characterize and forecast debris flow susceptibility in burned terrains using physics-based tools remains limited. In this project, we augment the Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological modeling system (WRF-Hydro) to simulate both overland and channelized flows and assess postfire debris flow susceptibility over a regional domain. We perform hindcast simulations using high-resolution weather-radar-derived precipitation and reanalysis data to drive non-burned baseline and burn scar sensitivity experiments. Our simulations focus on January 2021 when an atmospheric river triggered numerous debris flows within a wildfire burn scar in Big Sur – one of which destroyed California's famous Highway 1. Compared to the baseline, our burn scar simulation yields dramatic increases in total and peak discharge and shorter lags between rainfall onset and peak discharge, consistent with streamflow observations at nearby US Geological Survey (USGS) streamflow gage sites. For the 404 catchments located in the simulated burn scar area, median catchment-area-normalized peak discharge increases by ∼ 450 % compared to the baseline. Catchments with anomalously high catchment-area-normalized peak discharge correspond well with post-event field-based and remotely sensed debris flow observations. We suggest that our regional postfire debris flow susceptibility analysis demonstrates WRF-Hydro as a compelling new physics-based tool whose utility could be further extended via coupling to sediment erosion and transport models and/or ensemble-based operational weather forecasts. Given the high-fidelity performance of our augmented version of WRF-Hydro, as well as its potential usage in probabilistic hazard forecasts, we argue for its continued development and application in postfire hydrologic and natural hazard assessments.</p>

             <p>Accurate soil moisture and streamflow data are an aspirational need of many hydrologically-relevant fields. Model simulated soil moisture and streamflow hold promise but models require validation prior to application. Calibration methods are commonly used to improve model fidelity but misrepresentation of the true dynamics remains a challenge. In this study, we leverage soil parameter estimates from the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database and the probability mapping of SSURGO (POLARIS) to improve the representation of hydrologic processes in the Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological modeling system (WRF-Hydro) over a central California domain. Our results show WRF-Hydro soil moisture exhibits increased correlation coefficients (r), reduced biases, and increased Kling-Gupta Efficiencies (KGEs) across seven in-situ soil moisture observing stations after updating the model’s soil parameters according to POLARIS. Compared to four well-established soil moisture datasets including Soil Moisture Active Passive data and three Phase 2 North American Land Data Assimilation System land surface models, our POLARIS-adjusted WRF-Hydro simulations produce the highest mean KGE (0.69) across the seven stations. More importantly, WRF-Hydro streamflow fidelity also increases, especially in the case where the model domain is set up with SSURGO-informed total soil thickness. The magnitude and timing of peak flow events are better captured, r increases across nine United States Geological Survey stream gages, and the mean KGE across seven of the nine gages increases from 0.12 to 0.66. Our pre-calibration parameter estimate approach, which is transferable to other spatially-distributed hydrological models, can substantially improve a model’s performance, helping reduce calibration efforts and computational costs.</p>
